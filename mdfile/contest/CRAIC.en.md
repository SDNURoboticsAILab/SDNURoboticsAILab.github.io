## Competition Introduction

The CRAIC is a national discipline competition with a long history, large scale, and wide influence. At present, the competition has cultivated a large number of versatile talents in China who are "active hands", "daring to innovate", and "good at cooperation". The competition will be included in the national ranking list of subject competitions for ordinary colleges and universities and the analysis report of national competitions for ordinary college students released by the Chinese Association of Higher Education.

The competition is divided into multiple categories, including innovation competition, application competition, competitive competition, and challenge competition. The specific competition includes robot innovation competition, artificial intelligence innovation competition, intelligent cultural and creative innovation competition, intelligent manufacturing digital twin innovation competition, intelligent home appliance innovation competition, robot dance competition (multi legged alien, humanoid single, humanoid multi person, etc.), robot application competition (urban road autonomous driving, urban road recognition, intelligent inspection, intelligent driving, smart agriculture, smart home services, quadruped rapid logistics, intelligent production line application scenarios, intelligent catering services, smart retail, etc.), robot competition competition (Simuro football, combat, humanoid sprint, obstacle running, irregular terrain, penalty kicks,  ILoboke football, etc.) and robot task challenges (Aelos/Roban humanoid standard platform virtual simulation, small desktop level, all terrain adaptive robot design, autonomous cruising, target shooting, micro unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned collaborative systems, smart pharmacies, quadruped biomimetic medium/small, unmanned vehicle outdoor scenes, composite robot lunar exploration, etc.). These competition settings are closely aligned with industries related to "artificial intelligence+" and "robotics+", covering multiple fields such as services, agriculture, and culture, with the aim of promoting technological innovation and improving engineering practice capabilities through competitions. ‌

In addition, the CRAIC actively promotes the participation of students in innovative practices in robotics and artificial intelligence technology, improves team collaboration, and cultivates innovation and entrepreneurship spirit. The successful hosting of the competition not only showcases the innovative ability and technological level of the participating students, but also provides talent reserves and intellectual support for the development of robotics and artificial intelligence fields.
